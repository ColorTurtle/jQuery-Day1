#jQuery & JavaScript Assignment

##Overview
In this assignment we were tasked with using the bit of jQuery we knew to create 30 different interactions that we might have previously taken care of using CSS. Because of the power of jQuery we were also able to create changes to the interface that would be impossible to accomplish through CSS alone. 

A second assignment was appended to this where we were to write some simple javascript objects and functions that could could be called in the console. The specifications were as follows: 

1. Create 3 objects by storing them as variables with properties for each.
2. At least one property needed to be in an array.
3. At least one object needed to be able to manipulate another object. 

###jQuery Assignment
This was my first real tango with jQuery so it was a bit of a brain challenge for me, but it felt good after preforming all 30. I created a grid system of 30 divs for the basic structure with a different action being perfomed upon each div. In hindsight, the layout structure was pretty limiting due to the small space I had to work with.  Going forward I plan to keep the layout a bit simpler.

They are all pretty simple. My favs are 16, 17 & 18. Nothing to write home about, but fun to figure out.

###JavaScript Assignment

I have a love/hate relationship with zombies, so I created a zombie themed story using javascript. I stored variables 'zombieFred', 'Mason' & 'Blondie'. 'zombieFred' can groan, kill, scare and share. Mason & Blondie can both perform a nordicKill.
