#jQuery & JavaScript Assignment

##Overview
In this assignment we were tasked with using the bit of jQuery we knew to create 30 different interactions that we might have previously taken care of using CSS. Because of the power of jQuery we were also able to create changes to the interface that would be impossible to accomplish through CSS alone. 

A second assignment was appended to this where we were to write some simple javascript objects and functions that could could be called in the console. The specifications were as follows: 

1. Create 3 objects by storing them as variables with properties for each.
2. At least one property needed to be in an array.
3. At least one object needed to be able to manipulate another object. 

###JavaScript Assignment

I have a love/hate relationship with zombies, so I created a zombie themed story using javascript. I stored variables zombieFred, Mason & Blondie. zombieFred can groan & kill. Mason & Blondie can both perform a nordicKill. 

###jQuery Assignment
This was my first real tango with jQuery so it was a bit of a brain challenge for me, but it felt good after preforming all 30. I created a grid system of 30 divs for the basic structure with a different action being perfomed upon each div. In hindsight, the structure was pretty limiting due to the small space I had to work with.  Going forward I plan to keep the layout a bit simpler.

####Affects List Per Div.
1. Change div color - .addClass upon click
2. Change div color - .addClass upon hover
3. Expand div shape - .addClass upon click
4. Reveal message upon click - with .addClass
5. Animate shade up  & left upon click using .toggle, reappears on 2nd click. Began using .sibling to target elements. 
6. Animate to the right & shrink upon 1st click, reappear & expand upon 2nd click - using toggle
7. Animate shade up & down upon click using toggle
8. By hovering on a top div, you affect the layer below it. You can't do that in CSS which is pretty cool.
9. By clicking on the div you make it disappear.
*At this point in the assignment I knew I was taking too long to figure out changes, so for the next three divs I created a button that would change all three of them. Not sure that was a good idea.*
